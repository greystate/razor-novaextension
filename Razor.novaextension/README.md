# Razor Extension

This extension provides basic syntax highlighting for Razor Views,
along with some clips to help when coding views.

This is still a work in progress - mainly done to help me code Views for Umbraco,
but it does the basics of recognizing the `.cshtml` extension and providing
syntax-highlighting for it.
