# Razor Extension for Nova

This extension contains a (basic) language definition for Razor to support
editing .cshtml views in Nova.

Also contains some completions and snippets.

This has not currently (January 2022) been published as an official
[Nova Extension][NOVEXT] but that is definitely something I would like to do.
But of course, the horror of publishing something that others will maybe start
to use and maybe even rely on for work, terrifies me quite a bit and thus, it
suddenly has to be "perfect" before considering such craziness :)
